# Finite-s.i.-lattices

This repository contains all nontrivial subdirectly irreducible (s.i.) lattices up to isomorphism of cardinality up to 12. 

The file si_lattices_2-10_2554.txt contains all 2555 s.i. lattices of cardinality 2 to 10.

The file si_lattices_11_13867.txt contains all 13867 s.i. lattices of cardinality 11.

The file si_lattices_12_100853.txt contains all 100853 s.i. lattices of cardinality 12.

For the s.i. lattices of cardianlity 2-10 there is also the file HS_si_lattices_2-10.txt that shows which lattices in the file si_lattices_2-10_2554.txt are homomorphic images of sublattices of larger lattices in the same file. The numbering using in this file is the position of each lattice in the (0-indexed) list.
